Ali Zeck,AliBeckZeck,"For the #narcissist, there is no moral code, no integrity or morality clause that keeps them in check when they think their false self may be threatened. It’s about survival.

Ali Zeck,AliBeckZeck,"And I’m tired of seeing healing communities say “rise above” #narcissticabuse, that you can assign different meaning to it.. the concept of this type of abuse is your mind has been conditioned &amp; brainwashed-you can’t Eckhart Tolle your way out of it until you get your mind right",9,1,2020-03-30,1638,0

Ali Zeck,AliBeckZeck,"There’s never been a more critical time for human beings to practice critical thinking.

Ali Zeck,AliBeckZeck,"When an entire economy system is destroyed over a virus, whose numbers &amp; statistics simply don’t match up w/ reality, you will know the economy was wiped out to replace it w/ one of their own choosing.

Ali Zeck,AliBeckZeck,"And the people, who were traumatized by the sudden loss of consumerism &amp; ways they’d used to distract themselves, also lost their ability to interpret information from those in power...they were in a state of shock &amp; therefore inclined to believe whatever they were told",10,2,2020-03-21,1638,0
Ali Zeck,AliBeckZeck,"You can say what you want, quote #coronavirus stats, shows graphs, media footage, but the real contagion is us being asked to believe what they say is true, when everyone’s intuition is sounding alarm bells that something isn’t right about any of this-something is way off",64,22,2020-03-21,1638,0
Ali Zeck,AliBeckZeck,"I’m slow to pick up when I’m being gaslit by someone but I finally made the connection: the same type of dark, confusing energy I felt when I was on psych drugs is the same dark energy I feel now-we are being gaslit b/c this definitely doesn’t feel like what they’re saying it is",11,1,2020-03-21,1638,0

Ali Zeck,AliBeckZeck,What the #coronavirus is highlighting is that some people will put their own perceived entitlements &amp; selfish desires above the value of other human lives &amp; their safety.
